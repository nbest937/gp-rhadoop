gp-rhadoop: spin up a RHadoop cluster using Globus Provision
============================================================

To specify and start up an m1.small, 32-bit cluster use simple-ec2-rhadoop.sh.

To specify and start up an m1.large-bit cluster use simple-ec2-rhadoop-large.sh.

For now those scripts should be stepped through manually.  They are raw and untested, but the idea is to capture the necessary steps for eventual automation.  Shell variables in those scripts will have to be edited until we build in more intelligence.

The AMIs used with this configuration are:
32-bit: ami-b12ee0d8
64-bit: ami-652ce20c
HVM: ami-6d2ce204
